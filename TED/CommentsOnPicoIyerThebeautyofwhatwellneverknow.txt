I was very impressed and got a lot of resonance because both of us love travelling and foreign culture. I can't agree more with hime on that we should respect and show our fear on our ignorance. But I am a little confused with one point of the quotation from Dalai Lama "I do't know". We undertand our ignorance when we know more. But we must make choices and decisiones all the time as the life is moving one. For example when my wife askes me "What's for the dinner?", I will got nothing if I answer "I don't know.". And image this, what should you answer if a girl ask "Do you love me?"
