I was very impressed and got a lot of resonance because both of us love travelling and foreign culture. I can't agree more with him on that we should respect and show our fear on our ignorance. But I am a little confused with one point of the quotation from Dalai Lama "I donâ€™t know". We understand our ignorance more when we know more. And we are always overconfidence on our little knowledges. But we must make choices and decisions based on that all the time as the life is moving on, even if we may make mistakes. For example, when my wife askes me "What's for the dinner?", I will got nothing if I answer "I don't know.". And image this, what should you answer if a girl ask, "Do you love me?"
