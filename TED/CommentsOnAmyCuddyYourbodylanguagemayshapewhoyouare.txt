Three years ago, I heard a TED speech from Amy Cuddy, “Your body language may shape who you are”. In this speech Amy shared her understanding and story on how body language change peoples. I am impressed and encouraged by her point: “fake it till make it”. Usually we feel feared or frustrated when we face challenges or difficulties. We didn’t believe we can make it. But Amy told us: we can “fake” ourselves, believe we can do it as the first step. This may give us courage and then find it not so difficult. For an example, I think English is difficult, but maybe I decided to “fake” it that I can do it. Try my best to listen, read, write and speak. Not to go away from English. Then maybe someday I can make it.
