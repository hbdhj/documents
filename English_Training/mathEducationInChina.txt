Generally Chinese, especially younger Chinese, mathematics skill is pretty good. We can do the arithmetic of numbers below 100 without equation. We can solve the equation very quickly. And in the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) of 2015 China got the sixth place following Singapore, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan and Japan.
I think the direct reasons of this result are the Chinese teachers teach more and early and the students practice more.
The teachers will teach mathematics one hour at least from grade one of junior school. And solving equation will be taught from grade five. This is much earlier than other countries.
And the students practice a lot. The students need spend more than one hour everyday on mathematics homework.
The deep and indirect reasons of these results are mathematics plays a very important role in the Chinese Tests, from junior school to graduate school. This is because mathematics is the basis of the natural science, such as physics, chemistry and biology. If one student's mathematics is not so good those other courses will become more difficult for them.
And these tests matters a lot for a Chinese faith. His lives and career will be much easier if he got higher score and went to a famous university.
And engineering fields, such as construction, computer science and so on provided a very broad career and employment, which make mathematics more abstractive.
In fact Chinese are good at mathematics not because we love it but we need it.
So the Chinese genius who really love mathematics are pretty rare. None of Fields Medal (Nobel Prize in mathematics) was given to a Chinese.
