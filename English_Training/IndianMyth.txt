In this weekend, I watched a very interesting TED speech, East vs. West ¡ª the myths that mystify, from Indian mythologist Devdutt Pattanaik. In this speech Devdutt talkes several Indian mythes ¨C gods¡¯ stories, takes an eye-opening look at the myths of India and of the West -- and shows how these two fundamentally different sets of beliefs about God, death and heaven help us consistently misunderstand one another.

I like to share the story of Indian gods he shared as the opening. Ganesha, the elephant-headed god, and his brother Kartikeya, the warlord of the gods. The two brothers one day decided to go on a race, three times around the world. Kartikeya ride his peacock and flew around the earth once, twice, and thrice. But his brother, Ganesha, simply walked around his parents once, twice, thrice, and said, "I won." "How come?" said Kartikeya. Ganesha answered, "You went around 'the world.' I went around 'my world.'"

This shows the world of Indian myth is subjective, emotional, personal. There are more stories and comparisons in his speech, which show the differences between India and the west. I suggest you to watch this video too, which may help us to understand Indian myth, culture, and business discipline.
