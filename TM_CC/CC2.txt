Swimming

In the past several toastmaster meetings, Hu Tao and Qinqin had talked about their experience, their love to running. And Sherry had just finished her semi-marathon in last Sunday. Yes, running is pretty good. But today I’d like to say: swimming is much better than running, based on the following five reasons:

Firstly swimming is more safe and does less damage to our body. Several years ago I also ran. But someday I feel pain in my left knee. I went to hospital, the doctor suggested me run less. Then I asked: ”Which sport do you recommend?”. “Swimming of course!” He answered. My knees did not pain any more after I stop to run and start to swim. When you run, you must be very carefully and skillful. Otherwise you would get hurt. Zhang Huailing, one of our colleagues, just got hurt when he ran because he didn’t notice a little pit on the road.

Secondly swimming can make us taller. When we swim, the water will lift up us and our spine and joints got relax. This will make us a bit taller, just like sleep. We swim more and more we got taller and taller. So the tallest people are Hollanders because they swim a lot. After all one quarter of Netherlands are below the ocean. But when you run your weight will make you shorter and shorter. 

Thirdly swimming can make us more white. The water in the swimming pool contains chlorine. Chlorine can whiten things. We swim more our get more white: try to swim two hours and see your hands. But when you run outdoors the sunlight and haze will hurt your skin and make it dark. So we saw many marathon players are from Africa. But for swimming players we can see Sun Yang, Ning Zetao and Piao Taihuan. Oh Sorry! I forget an evidence just in this room: Dai Gang is our swimming champion.

Fourthly swimming can make us clever. When you run you still got many disturbance and attractions, you may need answer the phone, you can listen to music or glance at the beautiful girls. But when we swim, all of these are gone. The only thing we can do, except swimming, is thinking. Thinking will help us to build up the knowledge and make wise decisions. We can think about the working issues, family issues and even the gamble of world cup. We all know octopus “Polo”’s story. We think more and will become more clever. 

Fifthly and lastly swimming is a sport for our whole life. We can swim when we are babies and we still can swim when we are old. When I go to swimming I can see a lot of older women and men. Someday I ask one “how old are you?” “Ah, pardon!” “how old are you?” “Ah seventy-eight!”, he answered. I strongly doubt he can run, but he still can swim. And more swimming can lengthen our life: everyone know one fact: turtles live longest on the earth. They swim but never run. The oldest turtle lived more than one hundred and fifty years. 

So do you want to become tall and white? Do you want to become clever? Do you want to live longer? It’s very clear that swimming is your best choice, not running!
