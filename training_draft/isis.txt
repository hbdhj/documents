IS-IS
What is IS-IS
  The prferred routing protocol of modern ISPs
  The OSI Model was never meant to be just a model
    The OSI protocol, the alternative to the TCP/IP Model
    OSI is more complicated than TCP/IP
  In OSI terminology, a router = an intermediate system
  IS-IS was the routing protocol created for OSI
  Originally deployed by ISPs due to government regulations
IS-IS history and background
  The original implementation of IS-IS was modified to accomodate TCP/IP, Integrated IS-IS was born
  Integrated IS-IS still requires an OSI address, called a connectionless network services (CLNS) address to function
  The facts:
    Link State
    Uses SPF
    Uses hello messages
    More tunable than OSPF
      better resource utilization of device
    More flexible than OSPF
      less restriction on deployment
    Much more difficult to understand than OSPF

Understanding the design of IS-IS
  An IS-IS is only belongs to 1 area
  L1 router
    maintains routing information for area they belongs to
  L2 router
    maintains routes for just the backbone
  L1/L2 router
    maintains routes for specific areas and the backbone
    L1/L2 routers are used to move between areas
  L1 routers use L1/L2 routers to leave there network

More IS-IS facts
  The metric of IS-IS is not based on bandwidth but rather a value of 0-63, where 10 is the default
    the value is user defined, 0 could be a 10gig connection, 1 could be 1gig and so forth
  In OSI, End Systems (ES) would participate in routing, by finding their closet IS, known as an IS-SI
    similar to DHCP giving a default gateway
  L1 and L2 routers form like relationships and maintain separate database
    L1 will not form relationships with L2 router,
      what will work is L1----L1/L2-----L2, You would have to specify the network type under the routing process
  The L1/L2 router is similar to OSPF ABR

Comparing IS-IS and OSPF
  Routing domain
    Level 0
      ES-IS
      Stub routing
    Level 1
      L1 routers in the same area
      Transit or intra area
    Level 2
      L2 is routing between areas
      Inter area or transit
    Level 3
      routing out of your domain
      intra area external or inter area external
    IS-IS specifics
      handles updates more efficiently
        it batches the updates
      rarely runs the spf algorithm, prefers using partial route calculation(PRC)
      is much faster by default, to detect failures and coverage
      has less design constrains
      very easy to adapt to IPv6

Understanding NSAP Addressing
  OSI uses CLNP, connectionless network protocol address
  when you assign a CLNP address to a router, it is called a NSAP, network service access point address
  only one address needed per node, not per interface
  NSAP addresses can be up to 20 bytes in length
  The original implementation of OSI defined more than five fields that the NSAP address would represent
  Cisco's implementation of IS-IS only three of those fields
    the area address
    the system id
    the NSAP selector, NSEL
  the idea is to look like this
    49.123.aa15.b322.1841.00
      NSEL
        00<----
      system id
        aa15.b322.1841<----
      area
        49.123<----

Applying NSAP address to Cisco routers
  Rules of the NSAP address
    it can be up to 20 bytes
    last byte of address is always 00, representing an IS
    system id is always a fixed 6 bytes in length, similiar to OSPF router id
    The best way to read the address is from right to left, starting from 00 and going left until you hit 49
    The MAC address is commonly used to identify the IS
    49 is considered a private address

IS-IS routes packets
  IS checks a packet destination
    if different area, routes based on the area address
    if same area, routes based on the system id
  If it is a L1 router
    inter-area packets sent to closet L1/L2 router
    intra-area packets are routed based on L1 database
  If it is a L2 router
    inter-area packets are routed based on L2 database
    intra-area packets are routed based on L1 database

IS-IS packet types:
  Packet = PDU, protocol data unit
  network layer packet, network pdu
  data link layer frame, data link pdu
  type
    hello
    link state packet, LSP
    partial sequence number pdu, PSNP
      this is an acknowledgement to a LSP update
        this can also be a request for an update
    complete sequence number pdu CSNP
      this is a summary of the databbse, like OSPF

  +------+-------+-------+-------+
  |LSP   | TLV   | TLV   | TLV   |
  |HDR   |       |       |       |....... there are more than these three
  +------+-------+-------+-------+

  LSP HDR
    Contains PDU type, length, seq. number and life time
  L TLV
    Contains IS neighbor
  M TLV
    Contains authentication information
  R TLV
    Contains attached IP subnet information

IS-IS
  two network type supported
    broadcast
    point to point
  broadcast mode assumes full connectivity, all IS's cna reach each other
  broadcast mode elects a designated IS, DIS, that performs the same role as DR/DBR in OSPF
  when dealing with NBMA networks, point to point mode, subinterfaces, is the preferred design
  broadcast uses ulticast, point to point uses unicast

  Keeping databases sync'd
    LSP's are sent containing detailed route updates
    PSNPs are sent for two reasons
      to acknowledge LSPs
      to request missing LSPs

    CSNPs are sent once every 10 seconds in broadcast networks
    in point to point networks
      only once, when the link activates
