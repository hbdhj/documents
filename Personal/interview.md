# tell about yourself
I graduated from BUPT as Master at 2004 and my major is telecommunication engineer and optical communication.
I join SIEMENS and then Nokia SIEMENS Networks and began to develop software on telecommunication industry.
Five years ago I joined JDSU and now VIAVI. I learned a lot to develop large-scale software on network and began to act as the key developer for many components and got more and more involved in the design work and coaching of the internals.
In my work I got in touch with VMWare software and thought they were amazing. When I got there is a position open in your company I'd like to take the challenge and advancement.

# why did you want to leave the former company
I learned a lot for over five years on how to develop large scale software and got a good communications with my colleagues and supervisors. Recently I use VMware's vSphere to build up the development and thought it amazing. When I got there is a position open in your company and I thought I am qualified to it based on my pass so I decided to apply it.


# why do you want to work here (in this company)
The first reason is about the company and the product. VMware is a leading company in virtualization field and provided valuable software to the customers.
The second reason is about the colleagues. Everyone want to work with the genuies. And I know VMware got a lot.
The third reason is the personal reason. This build is very close to my apartment.

# Career plan in the next five years.
To be honest it is pretty difficult to take about the issues of five years later. First I'd like to talked about what I'd like to do in the first month. I will read the doc and code as soon as possilbe. And then I will try fix some bugs or some small feature. I prefer to learn during doing.
Then in the next 2 or 3 years I will work harder and actively to be experienced and skillful in related products and projects.
In the long term I consider to become a lead on the technology.

# advantages
I am active and eager to take challenge. Last July I take the responsibity to design, implement and test a proxy component. I took it and worked hard to read the document, code and make tries. At last we delivered it on time and gained praise from my supervior.
I am good at learn new technology. When I joined the JDSU, I only took two weeks to understand a very complex product, not only the overview but also the underlying logic.

# weakness
not very familiar to the technology
